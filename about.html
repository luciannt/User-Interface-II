    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Lucianna Tittle and I am currently in Lambda School to
      learn how to be a Web Developer. These past few days have been a
      <b>lot</b> to handle, but I think I'm doing alright. I've put in tons of
      effort, working until at least midnight on projects and educating myself
      on how to perform different actions as well. I am eager to learn more and
      be able to create functioning projects both for my personal happiness and
      for clients.
